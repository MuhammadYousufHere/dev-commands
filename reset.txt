git reset --hard master@{"10 minutes"}
git reset --hard master@{5.days.ago}

This will reset your current branch to the state it was 10 minutes ago or 5 days ago on the "master" branch, discarding any changes made after that time.

Note: Be cautious as this action is irreversible and can lead to data loss if not used carefully.
