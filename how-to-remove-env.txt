if you accedently pushed the .env to remote don't worry.

first => add .env to .gitignore
then => run $git rm -r --cached .env
make sure you have no unstagged or uncommited changes.

push the commit afer running first command.

now to remove it from the history

now => run $git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD

finally push the changes
git push -f 

that's it. but be careful next time.
